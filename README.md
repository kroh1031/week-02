# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description
[My Website!](https://kroh1031.github.io/week-01/)  
For this week's homework, I worked on making the code in both the HTML and CSS files cleaner and more consolidated.  
I was motivated to do so as I wanted to make the website more "accessible" and optimized for search engines.  

One of the steps I took to make this possible was replacing the nonsemantic (div) tags with semantic tags to give a better understanding of where certain contents go on the webpage.   
I also fixed a few errors in the code that prevented the website from functioning correctly.  
Furthermore, I included several comments throughout the code to make aware of the changes that I've made and how certain elements work the way they do.  
I got rid of classes when they were used unnecessarily and rather utilized the semantic tags to match the rules for styling.  

One thing I learned for sure during this whole process is that it is crucial to have a coherent, well-structured codebase as it will maximize its sustainability. 

## Installation
The steps that I took in order to deploy my website:
  1. First, I used the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.
  2. Then, I navigated into my GitHub repository's Settings tab.
  3. From the settings page, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section and selected the master branch as my source.
  4. After doing so, I was finally able to get the URL for my now deployed website.
